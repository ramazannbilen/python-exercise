RegEx VIII-B: Digit Character Class
Write the regular expression that will match all non-digit characters of a string. Use the character class \D in your expression.

Example
txt = "242Edabit2345can3443be3254324addictive!"
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

" ".join(re.findall(pattern, txt)) âžž "Edabit can be addictive!"
Notes
You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
Do not remove import re from the code.
Find more info on RegEx and character classes in Resources.
You can find all the challenges of this series in my Basic RegEx collection.
"You must use the character class \D in your expression."
